<h2>Introduction</h2><h7>Austin Fay <a class="w3-text-gray">January 6, 2018</a></h7>

<p>For as long as I can remember, I have been mystified by how computers actually process data at the hardware level. Sure, I was aware that desktop computers were comprised of a motherboard, CPU, memory, disk drive and input devices. I also knew that computers are "just ones and zeros." But beyond that, I was clueless. So when I finally learned the details about how actual computer hardware works, I couldn't help but inform everyone I know. Unfortunately, not everyone wants to know. So if you're reading this, you either clicked here by accident, or you really want to know how modern digital computing works at the lowest level. So that's what this site is about then. If you read the whole thing, you might have a good idea about how you might go about building a CPU.</p>
